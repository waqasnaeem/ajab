3538,Beyond the “nerd box:” How to explain methodology better,"You’ve done all the data crunching and reporting, now it’s time to sit down and explain how you did it. Feeling overwhelmed by too many information and worried nobody would read it? We’ve all been there. Some of us call it the “nerd box”, but we certainly hope the methodology section could reach beyond nerds. In this panel, a few experienced data journalists will talk about their approach to explaining the methodology and how we can improve to make it better. Topics we’ll touch on include: How to assure the visibility of important caveats and avoid confusion? How to set realistic expectation on readers’ data literacy? How to accommodate readers with different levels of interest? Is there any other way to describe methodology other than lengthy text? How to include the methodology for non-digital mediums like broadcast, radio, print or even social media? Join us for a rewarding discussion.

3722,Life after Code: The Computational Journalism Workbench,"Workbench is a new data journalism tool that combines scraping, cleaning, monitoring and visualization. In this hands-on, no-coding tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the Workbench for several different newsroom tasks. Create embeddable charts that update when new data is released, monitor a variety of data sources for changes and build sharable, reproducible workflows to clean and explore data. No coding necessary, but programmers are welcome to come learn how they can build new modules to empower other journalists. *Please note: You must bring your own laptop to participate in this class.

3723,Conversation: Women in the newsroom (Diversity Track),"This session will be an off-the-record discussion about being a woman in the newsroom. Some topics we'll bring up will include: Why is it that most of the people graduating from J-Schools are women yet newsrooms are still male-dominated? Why are women less likely to get promoted and feel way more undervalued in their work? Also, why newsrooms are so behind in having decent maternity policies?

3740,Conversation: Intro to BayesDB: Open-source AI that can help journalists search messy multivariate data,"Over the past ten years, researchers at MIT have been developing an open-source probabilistic AI software called BayesDB. BayesDB has the potential to allow users to answer a broad class of data science questions interactively, in seconds or minutes, without requiring statistical programming. Our team is currently working to understand how BayesDB can help journalists, with or without programming skills, identify and build their story. Specifically, we are in the process of developing tools for spreadsheet search, predictive modeling and time series forecasting. Come and learn more about our open-source probabilistic AI software and help provide feedback on how we can adapt BayesDB tools to better suit the needs and workflow of investigative journalists.
